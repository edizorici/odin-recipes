    <h3>Chicken Salad Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Chicken</strong>: chopped or shredded. If you have leftover
        roast chicken, grilled chicken, or rotisserie chicken, chicken salad is
        a great way to use it all up. You can also use canned chicken to make
        chicken salad (drain it first), or you can cook chicken for chicken
        salad. Use white or dark meat, or a combination of both if you prefer.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Mayonnaise</strong>: Creamy mayonnaise binds together all the
        separate ingredients for chicken salad into a satisfying mixture of
        flavors and textures. Use your choice of regular or reduced fat
        mayonnaise. In this chicken salad recipe, the mayonnaise is enhanced
        with a tablespoon of lemon juice for brightness and a ¼ teaspoon of
        ground black pepper. Taste the dressing before mixing it with the
        chicken; you may find it needs a little salt or other flavor-booster
        from your spice collection.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Celery</strong>: Fresh, crisp celery adds both flavor and
        crunch. Be sure to chop the celery into small, uniform pieces so it's
        easier to eat.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Almonds</strong>: Here's the secret ingredient that makes this
        chicken salad recipe stand apart. Blanched slivered almonds (available
        at any grocery store) are quickly pan-toasted to bring out their nutty
        flavor, and then added to the chicken salad mixture.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Chicken Salad Recipe Add-Ins</h3>
    <p>
      There's a lot you can do with a good basic recipe for chicken salad. Add
      minced fresh herbs like parsley, chives, basil, or tarragon. Add fresh
      grapes for juicy little bursts of flavor. Add cooked pasta to stretch the
      chicken salad into a larger meal. (You'll have to increase the amount of
      mayonnaise mixture to cover the pasta.) Add chopped apples and walnuts to
      make it a Chicken Waldorf Salad. Experiment with add-ins to make this
      chicken salad recipe your own.
    </p>
    <h3>How to Store Chicken Salad</h3>
    <p>
      Store chicken salad in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Stored
      properly, chicken salad should last for three to five days. If you served
      chicken salad over salad greens, try to store the greens separately to
      prevent them from getting soggy and wilted.
    </p>
    <h3>Can You Freeze Chicken Salad?</h3>
    <p>
      We do not recommend freezing chicken salad because the mayonnaise will
      separate as it thaws.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients we will use</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup blanched slivered almonds</li>

      <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>

      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

      <li>2 cups chopped, cooked chicken meat</li>

      <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place almonds in a frying pan. Toast over medium-high heat, shaking
        frequently. Watch carefully, as they burn easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix together mayonnaise, lemon juice, and pepper in a medium bowl. Toss
        with chicken, toasted almonds, and celery.
      </li>
